The Aim of the project is to create an online blog management application 
which user can use to create a blog, update, delete and read blog. 

this project is a single page application

Technologies used are â€‹ - HTML5, CSS , Javascript, Angular, Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

Features of the platform -

2) Autherization - Autherized user can edit and delete particular blog
3) CRUD Operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete operation

Blog Management - 

a) A view to create a blog - In this view first user should be logged in then he will be able to create a blog.

A few important points which I made use of-
1) Run the APIs in POSTMAN to see the response format. That will enable you to
<<<<<<< HEAD
	 easily use that in your Angular code.
2) The whole application should be single page with well defined View, controllers,
	 directives, services and middlewares.

3) Use jsonwebtoken for authentication and bcryptjs for password encryption.
